## Introduction
These codes are the experiments to **<font color=Blue>simulate Ring AllReduce algorithm</font>** in *Single* GPU by Pytorch.

Therefore, what you need is a **<font color=Blue>single GPU</font>** with **<font color=Blue>Pytorch</font>** available.

***BTW***, the annotations in the codes will be rewritten in **English** later, if I have spare time LOL.

## What's Ring AllReduce?

[Introduction of Ring AllReduce](https://marek.ai/allreduce-the-basis-of-multi-device-communication-for-neural-network-training.html#:~:text=Ring%20allreduce%20is%20actually%20a%20meta%20communication%20collective%2C,we%20send%20that%20message%20to%20our%20succeding%20neighbor.)

I really recommend the article posted latter(written in English one). After reading the article carefully, I believe that little problems would be occured for you to comprehend these codes.

## Ending

**Welcome** any questions about the codes~~~.
